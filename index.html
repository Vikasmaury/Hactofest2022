            Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source software by DigitalOcean that encourages
            participation
            in giving back to the open-source community.
            Developers get involved by completing pull requests, participating in events, and donating to open source
            projects. During this event, anyone can support open source by contributing changes and earn limited-edition
            swag.
            Every October, Digital Ocean and GitHub ship out free Hacktoberfest shirts to thousands of people around the
            world.
        </p>
        <p class="para2">
            Expand your open source contributions during Hacktoberfest 2022. Give back to open source projects during
            the
            month of October! This year, we're encouraging more than code contributions: writing, design, advocacy, and
            financial donations. Hacktoberfest is back for its ninth year!
